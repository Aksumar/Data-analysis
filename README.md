# Sales-Analysis
Sales analysis of the online electronics store.

This project is based on [tutorial](https://youtu.be/eMOA1pPVUc4).

I try to answer the following questions:
1. What was the best month for sales?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most?

Main stages of this analysis are:
1. Getting main info about data (top values, unique values, NaN amount, how orders are presented, etc)
2. Cleaning data from NaN
3. Adding necessary info to perform analysis
4. Answering questions.
